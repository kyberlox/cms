// packages/cms-utils, cms-react, admin and clearing Vite's dep cache while
// that dev server is already live racing to optimize the OLD bundle caused
// alcoris-site's own e2e login page to render blank ~2/3 of the time when this
// same logic lived in global-setup.ts there — a `pretest` hook is a fully
// separate process that npm guarantees completes before `playwright test`

// override / link-unlink toggle needed). client/ and the e2e-tested backend
// still only see whatever is currently built into each package's dist/,
// though — editing src/ doesn't take effect until a rebuild runs. This flag
// exists to make that rebuild explicit and opt-in rather than something every
// `npm run e2e` pays for.
