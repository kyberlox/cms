"""
Resource-limited Jinja2 SandboxedEnvironment.

`SandboxedEnvironment` blocks unsafe Python-object access (RCE) but not
CPU/memory exhaustion (`{{ "x" * 10**9 }}`, empty nested `{% for %}`
loops). This module adds: caps on `*`/`**`/`%`/`+`, a generic post-
call/filter size backstop, and a per-render budget on total `{% for %}`
iterations (any iterable, not just `range()`). Pair with
`render_with_output_limit` for cumulative output size.

Imported lazily — `jinja2` is a `cms`-extra dependency, not a base one.
Do not eagerly import this from `deepsel/utils/__init__.py`.

`MAX_OPERATION_RESULT_LENGTH` caps amplification *inputs* (`*`'s repeat
factor, `%`'s literal width) tightly, since no legitimate template needs
those that large. `MAX_CALL_RESULT_LENGTH` covers everything else
(`call()`, filters, `+`) at a higher, output-aligned cap, since those
have to tolerate large legitimate content, not just amplified bombs.

Accepted residual gaps:
- Recursive macros: bounded only by Python's recursion limit.
- `|map`/`|select`: iterate outside any `{% for %}` node, so the
  iteration budget doesn't see them (their result still hits the filter
  size cap).
- Server-supplied collections now share the same iteration budget as
  attacker-authored loops.

`Filter` nodes with literal args are constant-folded at compile time, so
`__init__` wraps `environment.filters` up front. Filters that allocate
memory based on untrusted width/size inputs (``center``, ``indent``,
``format``) are pre-checked *before* calling the underlying function —
preventing the allocation even during constant folding, not just
rejecting the oversized result after the fact.

As defense in depth for untrusted templates, this environment also
defaults `optimized=False` to disable Jinja compile-time optimizer
constant-folding.

# Cap for amplification-specific inputs: `*`'s repetition factor and `%`'s
